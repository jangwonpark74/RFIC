### ADC12DJ5200RF IC (JUN 05, 2019)
- An 8-GHz analog-input bandwidth, 20% better than competing ADCs
- 5.2Gsample/s sampling per channel with instantaneous bandwidth of 2.6 GHz (at 12 bits).
- A "slim" and fast serial interface using the JESD204C standard under various encoding modes, with 16 serial lanes supporting up to a 17.16-Gb/s line rate for efficient data transfer to the associated processor/FPGA.

- Full-scale input voltage of 0.8V p-p,
- a low noise floor of -151.8dBF/Hz (dual channel mode)
  and -154.4 dBFS/Hz(single-channel mode).

- 4-W power consumption from 1.1- and 1.9-V rails.
